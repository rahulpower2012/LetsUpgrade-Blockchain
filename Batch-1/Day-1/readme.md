## How is the verifiability of Blockchain has been attained?
#### - As there are many nodes or users o the blockchain, and each user has a copy of the blockchain. If new block is generated and its digital signature is generated it is matched and verified with the digital signature of the same block with other users in the network. If it does not match the user has to change the data in the block or blocks in backward manner until a matching digital signature is attained.
